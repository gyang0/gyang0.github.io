                        <p>Your standard inexperienced high schooler who finds it fun to code. I was born in California and spent some time there before moving to South Korea. My life so far was around 80% in South Korea and 20% in the states.</p>
                        <p>Other than coding, my hobbies include playing the violin and piano, collecting bottlecaps, derping around with Latin or Greek, and wasting time on the internet.</p>

                <h1>Qualifications</h1>
                <p>You're insane if you think a high schooler should have any qualifications other than knowing how to turn in assignments on time and avoid getting arrested.</p>
                
                <h1 class="subtitles">Coding</h1>
                <p>When I was in middle school, I couldn't even type on a keyboard. Now, my main hobby is to code.</p>
                <p>I first learned how to code by going through Khan Academy's ProcessingJS course. After that, I decided to enter a few contests. The contests helped me improve my coding skills. 2 years after my first contest, I finally got 1st place in the Advanced bracket.</p>
                <p>I also took some programming courses in school: C++ in 8th grade and Java in 9th. These courses gave me a taste of what widely-used programming languages were like. (ProcessingJS is a good starter language but quite limited)</p>
                <p>At that point, I wasn't sure what to do exactly. I had a murky idea that after college, I would get into a company and
                    work on the backend or whatever. But I also didn't like the idea of coding for projects that didn't interest me, even
                    if I was getting paid for it. Plus, I didn't want to end up designing Ad Rank for the rest of my life.</p>
                <p>Then I discovered quantum computing, which would let me combine the logic of programming with the thrill of contributing to an developing field. This was around the time ChatGPT had came out. People were suddenly doing a ton of AI/ML majors and it was quite annoying, so quantum computing was a niche I could see myself exploring. Currently trying to read up on the theory, looking to do more hopefully soon.</p>
