                        <p>Your standard inexperienced high schooler. I was born in California and spent some time there before moving to South Korea. My life so far was around 80% in South Korea and 20% in the states.</p>
                        <p>My current field of interest is physics, especially Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing. Other than that, I also find it fun to code, learn ancient languages, play the violin & piano, collect bottlecaps, and chase internet rabbit holes.</p>

                <p>You're insane if you think a high schooler should have any qualifications other than knowing how to turn in assignments on time and avoid getting arrested.</p>
                
                <h1 class="subtitles">Summary of My Life</h1>
                <p>I was born in California and moved to South Korea a little bit afterwards. Mom was a teacher at the same elementary school I attended, so after class ended I would usually spend time in the library until her work ended. To be brutally honest, I didn't learn anything at all in the elementary classes. All of what I learned back then came from the library &mdash; school was just a place of torture where you were forced to sit for hours a day while the lesson on fractions moved at a sickeningly slow pace.</p>

                <p>Initially, math drew me because of its logical structure; the "stern perfection" as Bertrand Russell put it. However, I never really considered it as a major, because to my impatient past self, it felt like the scope of math was confined to paper.</p>

                <p>My family moved to Colorado for a year and I attended middle school there. This was at the height of the pandemic, and I was spending lots of time online. I discovered coding on Khan Academy, and worked at it obsessively. I had a dreamy vision where as an adult, I would be paid to code to my heart's content. That illusion broke when I was attending middle school. Around that time, I realized that I would hate coding stuff I didn't like. Coding customer backends, fixing error after error, and maintaining vintage codebases seemed like a twisted version of coding. A major letdown. I tried algorithms for a bit, but quit them for the same reasons I quit math. So I decided that coding would be a hobby for me, which left me without a solid direction for a major.</p>

                <p>After starting high school, I discovered Quantum Computing, which seemed like the perfect combination of coding, math, and the thrill of a developing field. Which led me to Quantum Mechanics, which led me to modern physics. The equations and reality-warping finds got me hooked, and I started reading about it as much as my piles of homework would allow. It was amazing because everything was so mysterious, but also followed by logic and math.</p>

                <p>Surprisingly, I also found that I liked languages. It was unexpected because though I loved reading and wrote poems from time to time, I hated writing essays and analyzing every little detail in a story. Latin had a great structural feel to it; a great medium to write and read in. Ancient Greek was more difficult but had a more "flowy" feel. The grammar was harder, but it was nice too. The Romans had the right idea to be bilingual in Latin and Greek. Once you get tired of doing one, you can switch to the other and vice versa.</p>

                <p>My biggest regret for most things is not starting earlier. Whether math, coding, Latin, yoyoing, or poetry. I only really "found" physics in 10th grade, and had a lot of catching up to do compared to kids who had been breathing physics since they were 9.</p>
