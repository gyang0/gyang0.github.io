Figured I should probably start using a new profile pic instead of the Bill Cipher costume I did last year. This time I wanted to get more hands-on, so I tried sewing.

Started with buying a few black tablecloths. Two were 1.5m x 2.5m, and 4 were 1.5m x 1.5m. Left a little it of wiggle room incase I messed up. The thickness was normal, and the cloth was woven relatively tight. Overall it cost around $80.

I also got some pinking shears and a sewing kit from mom.

For the tunic, I cut off a general shape from both of the two 1.5m x 2.5m cloths. I didn't really consider arm holes, so it will probably look a little shabby &mdash; the best part about costumes is that you can accidentally make them haggard and it'll fit the "aesthetic."

To prevent fraying, I did a hem on the side that I cut. It's a crude one where I rolled up the edge once, sewed it, rolled it up again, and sewed that shut. Partially inspired by a <a href="https://www.seamwork.com/articles/sewing-french-seams">article on French seams</a> I read. I did a basic running stitch to save time.

Mid-way through October dad got a sewing machine. I spent a day at Grandma's learning how to use it. I decided to keep the hems I already did, because the crude sewing gave it a scrunched-up look that I thought was nice.

Around the end of October I was bombarded with major essays and decided to procrastinate.

Around the start of November I lost motivation and procrastinated some more.

Mid-way through November I decided I wanted to bring the costume with me to Homecoming in Boston. I ended up finishing most of the work in one night, just in time before the trip.

The two sides of the tunic were sewed together. The top was folded a bit to make it sturdier, then hand-sewed because I didn't have a strong enough needle to use a sewing machine.

Sleeves were attached pretty haphazardly. I just lined them up and ran the sewing machine over it. Luckily the stitches were sturdy.

I had to shorten the sleeves a few times because they were too long. I should've made my tunic narrower at the top &mdash; it overflowed a bit.

I don't even remember how I did the hood. I basically made a hood shape from a square piece of cloth, then sewed together places I thought needed sewing until it could hold a vague hood shape. The cloth is fine enough so that you can see through it, but it does limit vision somewhat.

Here's me at the Homecoming dance (took it off later because it was hot).
