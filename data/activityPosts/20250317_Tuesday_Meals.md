No one else is in the house on Tuesdays so I can make the foulest things without anyone to judge.

Started with a makeshift tuna sandwich on Tuesday, making some progress (and training my stomach for college meals).

    <figcaption>Got the bright idea to cook tuna along with rice. Bad idea. Tasted like cat food. Smelled horrible too. Almost couldn't finish the bowl.<br><br>I think the problem was that the moisture in the tuna caused the rice to get soggy. Plus, the tuna broke down instead of remaining relatively chunky.</figcaption>
