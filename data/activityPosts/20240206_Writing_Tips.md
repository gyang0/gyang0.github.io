Collection of tips from 8th - 10th grade English at OHS. Writing tips and general mantras drilled into the head of everyone. Most of the time it's about crafting strong thesis statements.

## Structure
- The unit of writing is the paragraph, not the sentence.
- Words are razor blades; don't treat them like bricks.
- Use as many paragraphs as you need, but paragraphs below 1/3 of a page likely have more to be said about, and paragraphs over 1 and 1/3 of a page are likely two paragraphs bleeding together.

## Essays
- Essays are a mode of inquiry, not a mode of declaration.
- Write about things that bother you in a work.

## Thinking
- Start with evidence (quotations, oddities in story, etc.) and find a thesis that reasonably explains them. Never start with the thesis and hunt for evidence.
- Extended-hand questions: questions that reach their hands to you from the text. Something that makes you stop and think. Usually great places to start with thesis statements.
- If your claim can be applied to any other story, it's too general and needs to be nuanced.
- After getting an idea, ask the "so what" question. (why is that detail important? Why does the author choose to include it?)

## General
- Quarantine an argument as towards the author and the world within the text. Avoid drawing from historical background.
- Avoid making a claim like "this moment is important because it moves the story towards its conclusion" or "this moment is important because it plays X part within the larger narrative". A scene can be important without just being a cog in the wheel for the plot.
- Every detail an author includes can be thought of as a choice, but the hard part is answering how all the details work together.
- Try not to pull all-nighters on essays. (I am bad at this)
