## Overview

[florr.io](https://florr.io) is a browser game where you play as a flower fighting insects. Defeated mobs drop petals, which you can craft for a chance to get a better rarity of that petal.

There are 3 zones: Garden, Desert, Ocean, and Jungle. Also a special biome called Hel where PvP is enabled. Occasionally, boss mobs called Super mobs will spawn, and that will be announced in the chat. Super mobs drop good petals, so a lot of players center their strategy around making it to the Super on time and damaging it enough to loot. The top 25 damagers will get drops.

Other than Super hunting, a lot of players will farm different zones for the petals they want, either actively with a DPS (damage-per-second) build or an idle egging build.

I've been addicted to this for the better part of a year. Quitting for a month or two to get a grip on life and focus on productive interests. Still, thought it might be fun to record the builds I use. Florr is a heavily strategy-based game, since you only have 10 builds that need to work for a variety of situations.

- **Small warning:** Please do not play florr. It's extremely addicting and not worth it.
- **Another warning:** This post won't make a whole lot of sense unless you've played florr before, ***which you shouldn't do***. The entire game is quite complicated and nuanced.

## Builds
1. General purpose
2. Ocean loadout
3. Hel loadout
4. Sponge burst/ram + mass heal
5. Panic heal + fast bubbling
6. Stealth bubbling
7. Super mob DPS
8. Clawing loadout
9. Lightning loadout
10. AFK loadout

*Note: When I'm playing, my builds tend to change regularly to keep up with new strategies. This isn't a fixed list.

## Terminology
- DPS: damage per second (the higher the better)
- AFK: away from keyboard (idle playing)
- SC: second chance. When you take too much damage, you can go to 0 health and not die **once every 30 seconds**. That's a simplified explanation, but you see how it works.
- Sponge burst: sponge spreads out the damage you take over a certain interval. When you take too much damage, your health will start to decrease even with sponge equipped. "Bursting" the sponge means swapping it out with another petal, effectively dealing all the damage at once. Synergizes well with SC.
- Perfrot: perfect rotation. Petals must be synchronized with their reload speed to instantly hit the enemy as they load, maximizing DPS. Most people sacrifice a slot to include a **faster** petal (which increases rotation speed) instead of using another DPS petal.
- Pink petals are Ultras, the 2nd highest rarity in the game.
- Blue petals are Mythics, the 3rd highest rarity in the game.

## 1. General Purpose
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_1.png">
    <figcaption>Chip serves as the DPS source, while others are utility petals.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the build I tend to use when I don't really need a specific loadout to survive. Chips are a good non-commital DPS source&mdash;a dicewheel would be better, but dice requires a faster and a clover to reach its full potential, while chips only need one faster. For builds where I need a lot of utilities alongside my DPS petals, chip is good enough.

Pretty standard main loadout (on top): 5 chips for DPS; faster for perfrot; sponge to delay damage; lotus for poison absorption (from spiders and scorpions); pincer to slow down fast mobs, and starfish to heal passively.

The bottom loadout are for petals I'll swap in depending on the situation: antenna to see my surroundings; bubble and yin yang for a quick escape; another starfish for when I take too much damage; a cotton to pop the sponge when I want to activate SC. Orb is for when I want a magic petal drop, and third eye is for when I need more range. Yggdrasil to revive dead flowers when I feel like it. Planks to block projectiles (mostly from hornets and wasps).

In desert, this loadout can be used as is. In garden and jungle, which are extremely projectile-heavy zones, swap in the two planks to block most of the missiles.

## 2. Ocean Loadout
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_2.png">
    <figcaption>Dice serves as the DPS source, while others are ocean-specific utility petals.</figcaption>
</figure>

Ocean is a place where you're expected to take constant damage from crab swarms and jellyfish. Dice has a chance to quickly destroy low-health mobs, which is important for clearing swarms (if your luck is decent, that is). Rubber will absorb lightning attacks, and fangs will heal you as you attack.

The secondary loadout is similar to the General Purpose one. Antenna for vision, bubbles and yin yang for quick escapes, backup heals with starfish, etc. One difference is the dandelion, which is used to prevent mobs from healing. Swap it in for starfish swarms, otherwise keep the rubber on for jellyfish hordes and crab attacks.

## 3. Hel Loadout
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_3.png">
    <figcaption>The priority is high mobility and burst DPS.</figcaption>
</figure>

Hel is the only zone where PvP is enabled. Petals you get from Hel are some of the best in the game (dice drops from Hel beetles), but you have to deal with stronger, faster mobs, not to mention others competing with you for drops.

3 stingers in the main loadout provides the DPS source. Tomatoes are another option, but they're harder to get, and during Hel Super fights, they'll break as you bump into others&mdash;not ideal. Stinger, being split into 5-6 parts, is much harder to get rid of entirely. In general, tomatoes are better for single PvP, and stingers are better for Hel Super fights.

2 starfish will be enough to heal you most of the time. If you're taking too much damage, swap in some cottons to absorb damage. Swap in a 2nd lotus during Hel Supers to guard against uranium and iris attacks. Use orb for a magic eye drop from a Super Hel spider, and shovel to redirect aggro. You'll need to bubble around pretty constantly to avoid swarms.

## 4. Sponge Burst/Ram + Mass Heal
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_4.png">
    <figcaption>Cacti and soil increase your health, working to stall damage somewhat.</figcaption>
</figure>

This one is a little hard to describe. Basically, when you take too much damage, switch to this and swap out the sponge. You'll take all the damage at once, but since the cacti and soil increased your health, it likely won't be fatal. Then press R to load in the secondary (which now has sponge!) and the dahlia will heal you quickly. Use this build when you want to preserve your SC for later. Synergizes with Build 5.

Also, if you're about to get pinned to a wall, switch to this to deal some damage before dying. You'll last longer with cacti and soil, disc will reduce collision damage, and the cutter will deal constant damage to the mob pinning you.

## 5. Panic Heal + Fast Bubbling
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_5.png">
    <figcaption>Used when I take too much damage suddenly, and when I need to bubble in low rarity areas.</figcaption>
</figure>

When you take a lot of damage and don't want to use SC, you'll need to use a sponge burst with Build 4. But since it takes some time to load builds, you ideally want to get your health up to 100% before switching to that, or you could die while bursting the sponge (e.g. health increase from cacti won't do anything if you're at 5%). This build is designed to synergize with Build 4. After taking tons of damage, switch to this. Cotton will stall any damage, while dahlia will heal you to 100%. Then switch to Build 4, burst the sponge, and use the mass heal secondary.

The secondary here is a fast bubbling build. Use in low rarity areas or for traveling to Supers. Swap in a compass to see where the Super mobs is.

## 6. Stealth Bubbling
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_6.png">
    <figcaption>Used for bubbling in high rarity areas.</figcaption>
</figure>

After I use my fast bubbling build to reach a high rarity area, I use this safer bubbling build. Starfish will help you heal, cactus will prevent you from dying too quickly, and 3 bubbles should be enough to keep up with other Super hunters. Poo is important: it decreases mob aggro range, so you won't get attacked as frequently.

The secondary is a collection of petals I've found useful. Yggdrasil and mark to either help or troll dead flowers, compass to see where I'm going, shovel to redirect aggro, and rubber to get out of swarms. Honey is an interesting petal. Mobs will be attracted to it, so what I do is drop it in one corner, wait for mobs to rush to it, and sneak past using any openings in the swarm. Quite useful when mob density is high. Bulb is used when I want to draw mobs towards me. Not used a lot, but the logic is that if I want to take off poo, I meant to get mob aggro anyway.

## 7. Super Mob DPS
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_7.png">
    <figcaption>Used to damage Super mobs</figcaption>
</figure>

Okay, so I've bubbled past mobs, preserved my SC, and made it to the Super mob. This is what I'll use to damage it. Dice has some of the highest DPS in the game, and stingers are pretty good too. Blood stingers might have higher DPS, but they're more risky since they force you to take damage.

The secondary is pretty normal: antenna, bubbles, starfish for backup heals, lotus for poison damage, and third eye for range. That air in the 10th slot is for sandstorms&mdash;Super sandstorms can suck you in, so equip air to increase your flower radius and resist the pull. You might've noticed the orb under sponge. Swap that in at the very end when you want a magic petal drop.

## 8. Clawing Loadout
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_8.png">
    <figcaption>Used to damage Super mobs when I'm early</figcaption>
</figure>

Claws deal extra damage if the mob is above 80% health, which can help you out-DPS people at Supers if you're early. I use one faster and 50% rotation speed to achieve perfrot.

The secondary is the same as Build 7.

## 9. Lightning Loadout
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_9.png">
    <figcaption>Used for specific Super mobs or for hordes.</figcaption>
</figure>

Lightning will bounce from one enemy to another, which makes it useful for Super centipede variants. Each Super centipede has 10 segments, so use lightning to try and loot them all. Lightning is also very effective on Super leeches. Other than Super fights, you can use this to mooch off eggsquads and clear hordes (but only if there's enough people&mdash;by damaging multiple enemies, you potentially draw a ton of aggro to the group).

The secondary is the same as Build 7.

## 10. AFK Loadout
<figure>
    <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20241226_florr_builds_10.png">
    <figcaption>Used for idly farming zones.</figcaption>
</figure>

AFK farming is kind of a controversial playstyle in the florr community, but it remains a part of the game. The strategy is simple. Sit in a corner with 1 magnet and 9 summons, then check back in every now and then to make sure you haven't died. Mobs will naturally attack your summons, and you'll get petals without farming them actively. In general, sticks are the best summons, beetle eggs are the 2nd best, and ant eggs are the 3rd best.

The secondary loadout has utilities focused on AFK playing. As usual: Antenna for vision; yin yang and bubbles for quick escapes.  Other than that: honey to attract passive mobs; dahlia to heal; and carrots to attack mobs far away (therefore getting aggro). Use yggdrasil to revive your squad and mark to annoy people.
