### Stuff Done
- Survived a hellish schedule from sophomore year (at one point, my wellness class ended at 2:30 am and I had a class right after at 7:45 am. Pulled an all nighter most nights, which kinda sucked).
- Co-founded the first Ancient Greek society at OHS. Met bi-weekly to do readings from *Athenaze*.
- Took AP Physics C (both Mechanics and E & M) over the summer so that I could take the entire physics sequence at OHS before graduating. This semester was Light & Heat&mdash;learned a lot about thermo and optics. Looking forward to dipping my feet in quantum mechanics next semester :D
- Expanded the OHS Pixel Orchestra board so we can transition smoothly after 2 of the co-leaders graduate this year.

<br>

- Tweaked website significantly.
- Few more Latin competitions, yada yada yada.

<br>

### Stuff Not Done
- Finishing *From Alpha to Omega*. I keep putting it off...I should really try to get the grammar down.
- Controlling florr.io addiction
- Learning how to pick locks

<br>

### Stuff To Do
- Found this thing called the F=ma exam. Looks fun, might try it out. Though if my past AMC experience is any indication, I'll probably bomb it &#129760;
- Learning situation-appropriate conversation starters

<br>

### Nice Memories
- Went to more events, met more friends.
- Successfully stole a foosball table from Terra house during S@S.
- Discovered the wonder that is *Despacito*.
