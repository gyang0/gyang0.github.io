Fractured notes based on the material in *From Alpha to Omega* chp. 3, which introduces a detailed overview for the grammar of Ancient Greek. I mostly skimmed it initially, but returned to it after learning more tenses.

As long as you know Latin, the grammar is mostly fine. The only confusing idea was the distinction between time and aspect.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <div>
        <p style="width: 800px; color: var(--dark-grayish)"><em>When it comes to Greek, the notion of "tense" can be problematic...The danger of using the term is that, on the basis of English, students may simply equate it with time and not realize that Greek makes an important distinction between <strong>time</strong> and <strong>aspect</strong>.</em></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;width: 800px; color: var(--dark-grayish)"><em>...The number of possible tenses in Greek depends on the mood of the verb.</em></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; float: right">(Chapter 3, pp. 14-15. Emphasis mine)</p>
    </div>
</div>

I think the idea of an aspect seems new because we don't realize that we use it all the time. Even when learning something like Latin, it's mostly implied that the tense shows time and time only (unless you really get into the linguistic machinery).

## Aspect
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <div>
        <p style="margin: 0; width: 800px; color: var(--dark-grayish)"><em>Aspect is the type or quality of the action, as perceived by the speaker. A Greek verb has one of three possible aspects: imperfective, aoristic, or perfective.</em></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; float: right">(Chapter 3, p. 15)</p>
    </div>
</div>

Then the book immediately introduces those 3 aspects:
- Imperfective aspect: speaker perceives action as continual/repeated process.
- Aoristic aspect: speaker perceives action as a one-time occurrence, neither continuing nor completed.
- Perfective aspect: the speaker perceives the action as complete.

For example, something like "I was going to school" would have imperfective aspect. Similarly, "I went to school" would be perfective aspect.

Aoristic aspect is the trickiest of the three. I think something like "I go to school" might have an aoristic aspect, depending on how you read it. Consider the action as isolated, where you're not *continually* going to school nor have *completed* going to school &mdash; then you've got an aoristic aspect.

## Time
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <div>
        <p style="margin: 0; width: 800px; color: var(--dark-grayish)"><em>A Greek verb in the indicative mood has one of three possible times: present, past, or future (A verb in the imperative, subjunctive, or optative mood never denotes time; the one exception, the future optative, is discussed in Lesson 40).</em></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; float: right">(Chapter 3, p. 15)</p>
    </div>
</div>

(Indicative tenses)
| Tense              | Time        | Aspect       |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Present            | Present     | Imperfective or Aoristic |
| Imperfect          | Past        | Imperfective             |
| Future             | Future      | Imperfective or Aoristic |
| Aorist             | Past        | Aoristic                 |
| Perfect            | Present     | Perfective               |
| Pluperfect         | Past        | Perfective               |
| Future perfect     | Future      | Perfective               |

These make sense if you think about it (and the whole shebang is much easier knowing Latin's tenses). The present tense, for example, can be shown by both "I am going to school" and "I go to school." The first shows imperfective aspect, while the latter seems to show aoristic aspect.

The "aorist tense" is pretty much like Latin's past tense. Consider ἐπαίδευσα, a first aorist active of παιδεύειν, which can be translated as "I taught." Just a simple past tense!

## All Together
It's fairly easy to see that aspect and time are separate things. In English, for example, something like "I was going to school" is a continual process *in the past*, and has **imperfective aspect** while showing **past time**. Meanwhile, something like "I am going to school" is a continual process *in the present*, and has **imperfective aspect** while showing **present time**.

It's a little less easy to see why that matters and whether you should consider it when reading Greek. My layman's conclusion is that it's not terribly important to know about aspect, as long as you know the relationship between tenses and time. Most (or all) languages will implicitly do the aspect thing for you: e.g. translating ἐπαίδευον (imperfect tense) will give you "I was teaching," which automatically has an imperfective aspect.

However, it can be helpful to know that, say, παιδεύω (present tense) can be translated as either "I teach" (aoristic aspect) or "I am teaching" (imperfective aspect). Might make certain sentences less clunky to read.

But really, just skip the whole time-aspect thing. The only thing is to remember that the "aoristic tense" is the simple past tense.
