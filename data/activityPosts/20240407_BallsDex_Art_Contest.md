TL;DR: BallsDex is having an art contest for 2 new countryballs: Mongol Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 4 separate contests will be held - spawn art and card art for each of the 2 balls.

My inspiration was from the balls whose spawn art I liked.

    <figcaption>These balls have nice shading. I also like how the character of each shines through.</figcaption>

Spawn art and card art are 2 very different styles, e.g.

Originally I'd planned on just doing Mongol Empire, but Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was fun to design too.

I put the sketches into Krita and used a tablet to make the digital version.

Result: didn't win either. Oh well.
