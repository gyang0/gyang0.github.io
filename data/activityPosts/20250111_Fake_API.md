GitHub pages is a great option for hosting static sites. It's the reason I could make this site you're seeing right now.

The thing is that it's static. No fancy functionality you get with a server. This is an outline of a method I used to mimic the process of making API calls within a static site.

## The Problem
Most API calls done in JS use the fetch API with the necessary parameters, e.g.
```js
async function getData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.org?endpoint=blahblah&api_key=[API KEY HERE]');
    const data = response.json();

    return data;
}

// Alternatively,
async function getData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.org?endpoint=blahblah', {
        headers: {
            Authorization: '...'
        }
    });
    const data = response.json();

    return data;
}
```

For a static site, all content is visible to the client-side. Which means visible API keys, which means bad stuff. Though it probably won't ever matter for a small site like this, it's a tad uncomfortable. Like having your fly open during a concert.

With Node.js, this wouldn't be a problem: just put the variables in a .env file and access them with `process.env.VAR_NAME`. But again, GitHub pages is static, so no Node, no servers, only pure JS. So if you really want at least the semblance of live data on your site, things get more messy.

## The Process

</figure>

Above is the simplest process I could code up. The Task Scheduler calls `update_routine.sh` every few days (I chose 1 week). So it's not exactly "live" data. It's more like data that's stored beforehand to give the impression of being live.

Additionally, the data was capped to save space. One piece of data was limited to the 100 most recent items, and another was limited to items recorded in the last month.

A benefit of storing the data is that it saves massively on API calls. I just need to do 2-3 API calls every few days to update the data, then use that instead of calling every time. This works because I'm not dealing with stuff where it's important that things be up-to-date.

Also, no API keys are visible at all, since they're all stored locally.

## Code
Here's the bare bones version of the important files as they are currently:

<div><p style="margin: 0"><strong>Website/update_routine.sh</strong></p></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Switch to Website Updater & call update.mjs
cd ../'Website Updater'
node update.mjs

# Come back to project folder
# Commit changes only for the JSON file that stores data
cd ../'My Website'
git add data/randomData.json
git commit -m "Routine update $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" data/randomData.json
git push origin main
```

<div><p style="margin: 0; margin-top: 50px"><strong>Website Updater/update.mjs</strong></p></div>

```js
// Import necessary stuff
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path';
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

const __dirname = path.resolve(path.dirname(''));
dotenv.config() // .env variables :D


// Fetch data
async function getData(){
    const response = await fetch(`http://example.com?endpoint=blahblah&api_key=${process.env.MY_API_KEY}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    return data;
}

// Rewrite Website/data.json file with new fetched data
async function load(file_path){
    let data = await getData();

    // Rewrite external JSON file provided
    let content = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file_path, 'utf8'));
    content = data;
    fs.writeFileSync(file_path, JSON.stringify(content, null, 4));
}

// Get JSON file path
// Currently: '../Coding Projects/GitHub/Website Updater'
// New: '../Coding Projects/GitHub/Website/data.json'
const DATA_FILE_PATH = path.join(path.dirname(__dirname), 'Website', 'data.json');
load(DATA_FILE_PATH);
```
<p></p>

Then I read the updated JSON file from several JS files within the `Website` folder whenever I need the data. Pretty neat. Now all I need to do is make `update_routine.sh` run every week.

## The Task Scheduler
Now we have to use the task scheduler. It's like cron, but for Windows, which is my main OS (I know, I know, but I have to use some Windows-only products for school).

It was surprisingly easy to use. I just made a new folder called `Personal Website Update`, and set a weekly task to run around Saturday morning in my timezone.
<figure>
    <img style="width: 400px" src="/images/activity/20250111_fake_api_2.png">
    <figcaption>Weekly task</figcaption>
</figure>

I also checked the 'Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed' option in the settings.

    <img style="width: 400px" src="/images/activity/20250111_fake_api_3.png">

</figure>

Here I encountered a slight issue. It looked like the Task Scheduler didn't accept whitespace in file paths, so the path to `update_routine.sh` wasn't being handled properly. I decided to remove the bash script from the `Website` folder and created a new `Personal_Website_Update` folder in `C:/Users/user/` to put it in instead. The final path to the bash script looks like `C:/Users/user/Personal_Website_Update/update_routine.sh`.

This also meant that I had to revise the file paths within the bash script. It wasn't too hard, luckily. I just replaced the relative paths with absolute ones.

To test, I ran the task again, and we were good to go:

## Aftermath
You can check this site's <a href="https://github.com/gyang0/gyang0.github.io/blob/main/data/randomData.json" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for more details, though the code is pretty hard to trawl through. The Music and MonkeyType sections are populated by `update_routine.sh`. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/gyang0/gyang0.github.io/commits/main/" target="_blank">commit history</a>, there are some routine updates sprinkled in (marked by `Routine update YYYY-MM-DD`). The proportion of routine updates will grow as I wrap up the work on this site by spring.

Check out the <a href="random.html" target="_blank">Random page</a> to see it in action.

Another option was to stop using API stuff on a static site instead of writing a few hundred lines of code to patch around it &#x1FAE0;
