Someone I know made a counter to the Flat Earth stuff, so a mod got upset and banned him. I joined out of curiosity and also to give context for the ban, since his messages were all deleted.
           
Since it claims to be open to both Flat Earthers and Globe Earthers, they have roles for each. From what I remember, the Globe Earthers outnumbered the Flat Earthers significantly. I think there were only 2000 or so members with the Flat Earther role.

The Flat Earthers don't seem to believe in a Flat Earth as much as they want to disprove the Globe Earthers. They have a pretty condescending attitude to counters against a Flat Earth. A common response is that all the evidence is a government conspiracy. I saw the word "sheep" a lot.

I'd say around half the forum is actual discussion (if you can call it that) and the other half is lewd jokes/random topics.

Unfortunately I didn't get to browse more, because after I sent an imgur link with context for the ban, it was immediately hidden and someone called a mod to ban me too. This happened less than 15 minutes after I joined. That was a heck of an experience.
