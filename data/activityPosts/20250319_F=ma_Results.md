F=ma is a 25-question multiple-choice quiz in February, open to US citizens and residents. It's the first competition in the Physics olympiad sequence. After you pass F=ma, you're invited to the USA Physics Olympiad, then the training camp, then the International Physics Olympiad. Around 400 people are chosen annually for the USAPhO, of all the people in the US.

Since I discovered Physics quite late, I felt like I needed to show a good score to prove myself in it. Starting August 2024, I attempted to study for it with past papers &mdash; just solving the questions and reviewing solutions as much as I could. It was hard to find time to fit this in, since I was already devoting a lot of time to school. Compared to my studies for the AMC previously though, I think I was much more motivated for F=ma, since it was something I was actually choosing to do instead of doing for the sake of "everyone else does this."

Starting December, I started staying up late most nights to squeeze in 3-4 hours every day for study. After midnight was the peak time: no one else around, everything quiet, and usually all my homework would be done by then. I reviewed the old papers but saved the more recent papers for practice. <a href="https://kevinshuang.com/category/fma-exam/" target="_blank">Kevin S. Huang's F=ma solutions</a> were a great resource that I used a lot. I also found that I was subconsciously starting to memorize the solutions instead of actually solving them, which wasn't good. So I made a basic question randomizer to practice with.

I recently uploaded that to GitHub.

A new requirement for the 2025 F=ma was that the test taker needed to actually be in the US. Since I live in South Korea, I had to travel to a testing center in California. Racked up a few more absences and had to do a lot of work in advance, since I wouldn't be able to do as much during then.

The exam was about as expected, I think. Not too easy, not too hard. The one thing was that questions 1-10 felt harder than questions 11-20. One question about a swinging rod and ball was very similar to a past one (it could be solved by conserving angular momentum instead of energy). I had to skip a question about the statics of a 3-ball system, because I didn't know how to approach it.

Immediately after I handed in my test, I realized I had probably gotten question 1 wrong. Stupid mistake &mdash; should've used $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$, not $v_x + v_y$. Even if I got this one right, it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I might've gotten something else wrong, made a bad guess, and so on. Still, it's hard to stop thinking about, especially given the result.

On February 20, it was announced that there had been an exam leak. I don't know how severe it was or how it affected the cutoff. This was removed this from the <a href="https://aapt.org/physicsteam/2025/news.cfm" target="_blank">announcements page</a> in March.

On March 19, my parents and I contacted the AAPT to get my score. It was 14/25, so I missed the cutoff by one point. Certainly very disappointing. This was the first olympiad-type exam that I studied for out of my own liking, so I guess I expected everything to work out like a fairy tale if I put in the effort. Then again, there are people that have probably started earlier and worked harder than me. It feels easy to blame bad luck and think about the few more questions I could've gotten right, but overall I think nothing would have changed much, if I had to take it again.

It's also tempting to blame the leak &mdash; "what if this brought the cutoff up?" At the same time though, I don't know how this affected the cutoff. AAPT said they worked on an equitable solution, and I trust them to have made the best decision possible given the circumstances. It might even be that the cutoff was lowered to accommodate for the honest students. Easy to blame the cheaters for the months of late nights I spent studying gone to waste, but in the end it doesn't matter and I did learn a fair amount.

This will be my first and last time taking F=ma, since it's hard to travel a dozen hours just for a single exam, and I'm graduating next year anyway. I definitely wanted to make it to the olympiad this year, but in the meantime I'll try to look into other things I can do with physics.

Good luck to the 518 who made the cutoff!
