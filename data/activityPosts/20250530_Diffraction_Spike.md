Entry for <a href="https://www.aapt.org/Programs/photocontest/index.cfm" target="_blank">AAPT Physics Photo Contest</a>. My idea was to capture a diffraction spike. A pretty nice effect that comes up in photography. You can even see it by squinting at the sun.

Based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> for diffraction spikes, it looked like there were 2 main ways to form them: either through side diffraction (shape of aperture) or by putting an overlay on the aperture (like a cross).

First I tried to determine what aperture would give the clearest pattern. I made 3 to test this:

</figure>

Then I placed these over a green laser pointer and took photos to test.

Unfortunately, it turned out that cameras aren't good at capturing diffraction patterns, especially in the dark &mdash; I guess it reflects too much or something! Some things that helped were aiming the laser at a piece of paper instead of the wall, and adding a small light source behind me so it wasn't complete darkness.

I stuck with just side diffraction, since that seemed to give the clearest spike. Then I made more aperture shapes according to this chart:

My original plan was to use 3 laser pointers, with "square," "pentagon," and "hexagon" aperture shapes. But the other 2 pointers I had were red, and it looked like they didn't capture well on camera. So I just stuck with the green pointer. I settled on the hexagon aperture, because it was hard to get the pentagon right.

Here's my setup:

These are some pictures I took:

This is the one I ended up choosing, along with my short description:
<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; margin: auto; justify-content:center; width:1300px; border: 5px solid var(--dark-grayish); vertical-align:middle">
    <div style="width:600px; align-self: center">
        <img style="width:600px" src="/images/activity/20250530_diffraction_spike_11.jpg">

    <div style="width:650px; margin-left:20px">

        <p style="font-size:17px; line-height:30px; margin-bottom: 20px">Ever squint at the sun and see what appears to be a ring of spikes around it? This pretty phenomenon is possible thanks to the wave nature of light. When light meets an obstacle, it doesn’t stop, it spreads out around it in a process called diffraction. Diffracted light waves take different paths to get to the same spot, and the way they interfere with each other causes variation in intensity. It’s easiest to see this with small obstacles–eyelashes, for example. When you look at the sun, light is diffracting around your eyelashes to create the spikes you see.</p>
        <p style="font-size:17px; line-height:30px; margin-bottom: 20px">My photo demonstrates this effect without causing permanent damage to your retinas. Using electrical tape, I constructed a small hexagonal aperture of side length 1mm and placed it over a green laser pointer. By turning the pointer on and dimming the lights, a bright hexagonal illumination can be seen, along with a spike emanating from each corner. Light waves are diffracting along each edge of the hexagon, combining constructively to produce bright lines in some places, but also destructively to produce dark places in others. The combined effect is a distinct six-sided star. As the number of sides increase, the number of observed spikes would grow. A perfectly circular hole, which can be thought of as having infinite sides, would have infinitely many spikes–the circular disk of light that we’re used to.</p>
